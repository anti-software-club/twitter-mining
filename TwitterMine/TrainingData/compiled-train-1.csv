+0.44 We should work together to cut taxes for hardworking middle-class families, not take health care away from 13 million people just to give the largest corporations massive tax cuts.
+0.44 I met with Kirstjen Nielsen, nominee to be next DHS secretary, this morning and urged her to extend Temporary Protected Status for the 60k Haitians already here in the U.S., instead of sending them back to a country that can’t support them.
+0.44 Filed several amendments to the GOP’s tax bill today to cut taxes for the middle class, make it easier for seniors and small business to file their taxes, and help Florida’s citrus industry replant millions of trees lost to citrus-greening.
+0.44 To all the brave men and women who serve in our nation's armed forces: Thank you! #VeteransDay
+0.44 I just introduced the FAIR Heroes Act to ensure our most seriously injured veterans have access to the health care that best fits their needs.
+0.02 Ryan stripped my 01 AUMF repeal amdt from DOD Approps in the dead of night. This is underhanded & undemocratic. The people deserve a debate!
+0.02 .@HouseGOP has betrayed the American people today. Now more than ever we need the resistance as we turn our sights to the Senate to stop the #GOPTaxScam once and for all.
+0.02 This #GOPTaxScam would “expand” the child tax credit to the rich while excluding 23 million children in low-income households – including 4.6 million African American children. @HouseGOP - stealing from poor kids is heartless.
+0.02 This bill is a disgrace. It eliminates deductions for student loans & medical expenses. And it sets the stage for a trillion dollar cut to Medicaid and Medicare. All in order to deliver a massive tax break to the GOP’s donor friends.
+0.02 Republicans are trying to pull a fast one on the American people. The #GOPTaxScam does nothing for the middle class or working families. It lines the pockets of the wealthiest 1% and makes it easier for corporations to ship American jobs overseas.
+0.01 Because we persisted, the U.S. Senate allowed Anita Hill to tell her history-making story to the nation. Americans heard her and, in 1992, tripled the # of women to the Senate and elected a record # of women to the House (24 new members).
+0.01 We can't let @realDonaldTrump politicize the courts! We're urging @senjudiciary Chairman @ChuckGrassley to uphold the longstanding #BlueSlip policy, which prevents the Committee from considering a judicial nominee w/o the approval of both senators from the nominee’s state.
+0.01 Honored @NancyPelosi has appointed me and Kenneth Morris, Jr., the great-great-great grandson of Frederick Douglass, to serve on the Frederick Douglass Bicentennial Commission, which was established by my bill. Looking forward to the bipartisan work of honoring Douglass' life!
+0.01 Sat down with Anita Hill today to recall her courageous stand against sexual harassment and the march to the Senate by a few House Members and I to demand she be allowed to testify. Her bravery and poise continue to inspire women to stand up as sexual harassment leads headlines.
+0.01 DC is a proud sanctuary city that will not be intimidated by the Trump administration. We will continue to protect our immigrant residents as they continue to contribute so much to our city.
+0.00 My friend @SenWarren & I today wrote the Oversight Board for #PuertoRico calling for complete write off of PR’s debt obligations post-Maria. Must put the people of Puerto Rico before Wall Street hedge funds! Read more:
+0.00 The new Director of the @CFPB must be someone with a track record of protecting consumers & holding financial firms responsible when they cheat people. This is no place for another Trump-appointed industry hack.
+0.00 At the @CFPB, Rich Cordray forced the biggest financial institutions to return $12B directly to the people they cheated. He held big banks accountable. He's a dedicated public servant & a tireless watchdog for US consumers – & he will be missed.
+0.00 This is important. @realDonaldTrump has cited the death count to argue his disaster response to Puerto Rico was top notch. It appears many hurricane deaths are going uncounted. Each day that passes makes it tougher to figure out the true total.
+0.00 Let me be clear: If Trump doesn’t keep his word & Congress doesn’t pass a clean Dream Act, I won’t vote for a spending bill without it.
+0.00 The future of 700k Dreamers as American as you & me hangs in the balance. Do your job, Mr. President. Stop playing politics & fix this.
+0.00 I'm heartsick for the victims, families & community of Sutherland Springs. But I'm more than heartsick – I'm angry.
+0.00 How many more people must die at churches or concerts or schools before we stop letting the @NRA control this country's gun policies?
+0.01 A picture is worth a thousand words, and this graph I shared on the House floor exposes the #GOPTaxScam—a one-year tax cut followed by nine years of tax hikes for average taxpayers.
+0.01 We must expose the #GOPTaxScam as the bill heads toward likely passage tomorrow. It’s a giveaway to corporations, millionaires and billionaires at the expense of everyday Americans.
+0.01 I’m glad @SpeakerRyan followed our example to require sexual harassment training for the Member and our staff. That still leaves Congress w/out the same comprehensive workplace protections as the executive branch and private sector. My bill would fix that.
+0.01 Today’s Quiet Skies Caucus briefing by FAA and DoD officials on helicopter noise offered some ideas for DC. I will be hosting a community meeting on DC helicopter noise in the near future.
+0.02 Kim, a Cal Berkeley graduate, is one of the 800,000 #DACA recipients who call America home. She is my constituent and I'm fighting on her behalf to pass a clean #DREAMActNow!
+0.00 Every American who isn't rich or a big corporation should take today's tax scam vote as a slap to the face. We will keep fighting for you. Our promise. 
+0.00 We need a tax plan where corporations and the wealthiest pay their fair share. Not one that burdens working families and takes away health care from millions. #GOPTaxScam
+0.00 Defrauded students deserve every penny they were scammed out of by #4profit colleges. Glad to help with this effort.

+0.12 Prince George’s County has more than 210,000 Medicaid recipients—many are children, disabled...the most vulnerable. We must stop this.
+0.12 It became clear today that yesterday’s shooting in Northern California was related to domestic violence. This connection is not unique - a majority of mass shootings are tied to domestic violence.
+0.14 Yes, we've been down this road before. Let us hope that common-sense once again triumphs over arrogance and self-indulgence. #GOPTaxScam
+0.14 Hey @HouseGOP & @SenateGOP: Too many Americans struggle to pay their rent, mortgages & edu expenses. Why on earth would you push for this disastrous #GOPTaxScam that compounds that struggle & rips health coverage away from 13M Americans? Seriously, how #OutOfTouch can you be?
+0.14 Hey @FCC: Why would you want to cut access to affordable phone & internet service for 7.3 million low-income Americans? We need #LifelineForAll to ensure all Americans receive affordable internet and phone access!
+0.14 Despite #Lifeline enrollees in TX, FL, and Puerto Rico still recovering from devastating hurricanes, @FCC is proposing to cut their access to affordable internet and phone service. We need #LifelineForAll to ensure all Americans receive affordable internet and phone access.
+0.14 Again, in no way does this bill water down regulations on payday lenders or the @CFPB payday rule (which I've proudly supported since day 1). It's a complex issue but my staff is always here to address any concerns my constituents have about my legislative efforts: (202) 225-4572
+0.14 For those with access to bank loans, we want to ensure absolute certainty around the agreed upon terms, including the interest rate. We don’t want banks to sell that loan to a 3rd party where terms/rates change. That’s why we need uniformity. And that’s what this bill guarantees.
+0.14 We don’t want them to turn to payday lenders where they’ll have to agree to interest rates they can't possibly afford. We don't them thrown into a cycle of poverty that's impossible to escape. We want to make sure low-income people have a sensible place to turn for a fair loan.
+0.14 I'd be happy to, @dendria. Thread: Too many Americans don’t have access to loans. Why is this a problem? For those who earn hourly wages, a broken-down car can potentially be a life-altering event. If you don’t have money to quickly fix it, chances are your job is on the line.
+0.14 Sadly this article got it wrong, @rotowiremario. This bill only ensures banks, NOT payday lenders, will continue to operate in a safe and sound manner so they can continue to provide loans to low-income people. My staff is standing by to talk this through with you: (202) 225-4572
+0.14 I appreciate your concern, @YDSMarquette. Despite what this article says, in no way does the Access to Credit Act water down regulations on payday lenders. My staff is more than happy to go over this with you & address any of your questions. Feel free to call us: (202) 225-4572
+0.14 CIA just told me: The Dir stands by and has always stood by the January 2017 Intelligence Community Assessment entitled: Assessing Russian Activities and Intentions in Recent U.S. Elections.  The intelligence assessment with regard to Russian election meddling has not changed.
+0.15 Colleagues & I recently urged @SpeakerRyan to explain support for @realDonaldTrump's unnecessary border wall,which would use eminent domain to take citizens’ property along the border. Do they really want to force families to fight for their land in court for a useless wall?
+0.15 .@RepRubenGallego, @RepBetoORourke, @RepJoseSerrano, @RepJuanVargas, & Vicente Gonzalez wrote to Speaker Paul Ryan urging him to clarify his position on the use eminent domain to obtain land for the construction of Trump’s wall. 
+0.15 Spoke out on the #GOPTaxScam today which is terrible deal for all but billionaires & corporations who get huge tax breaks while others foot the bill. It targets Medicaid, Medicare, ACA subsidies, and many deductions that people in #TheBronx rely on.
+0.15 @TaxPolicyCenter analysis sums up the #GOPTaxScam perfectly. By 2027, the top 0.1% will get an avg tax cut of $320,640 while 36 million middle class families see a tax hike.

And today, House Republicans hold a vote on the #GOPTaxScam that would hike taxes for 36 million of those families so corporations and the wealthy get more. 
We need to stop this from happening. 
RT if you agree!
+0.19 Mandating sexual harassment training in Congress is a necessary first step. But since sexual harassment is often about power, we must also update the OOC dispute resolution process so that our staff have an advocate just as powerful. Watch here:
+0.19 We call for the quick adoption of mandatory sexual harassment prevention and response training for Members of the House, congressional staff, and other employees of the House.
+0.19 Follow @HouseAdm_Dems today to watch this morning's hearing on preventing sexual harassment in the Congressional workplace:

+0.23 At a time when people are struggling to pay rent and mortgages, payroll and health insurance, and tuition and student loans, the #GOPTaxScam eliminates the Work Opportunity Tax Credit which helps employers create jobs.

+0.23 With all due respect, Mr. President, do you understand what you are saying? Your #GOPTaxScam raises taxes on 38 million middle class families. And now, you want to raise premiums on millions of families to throw even more tax cuts to the rich?

+0.24 Phone lines, social media & mailboxes are being flooded with comments from people demanding that Congress stop doing the bidding of the biggest donors & corporate lobbyists & get back to doing the peoples’ work. Those calls, emails, letters & social media posts need to continue.
+0.24 I want to be clear: this fight is not over. The phones in my Washington office starting ringing off the hook today, just as they did each time Republicans tried to gut the American healthcare system earlier this year.
+0.24 Republican leaders in the House knew they would need to rush this kind of bad news through before the American people could find out what they were up to.  That’s exactly what they did with today’s vote.
+0.24 50% of the benefits under this plan go directly to the wealthiest 1%. 36 million Americans will face higher taxes, many of them New Yorkers. This plan will hurt teachers, students, veterans, people with cancer and Alzheimer’s and anyone with a job that can be moved overseas.
+0.24 I remain strongly opposed to the Ryan-McConnell plan to raise taxes on millions of middle class families, rip away their healthcare & explode the deficit, just to give massive tax handouts to some of the wealthiest individuals & corporations in the world. #GOPTaxScam

+0.28 The tax bill the #GOP just passed without a single @HouseDemocrats vote is one of the worst bills I have ever seen brought to the House floor. Thanks to this bill, the middle-class will be directly paying for an upper-class and big corporation tax cut. http://bit.ly/2AUQUw3

+0.28 I’ve long fought to ensure liver transplants are made available to patients w/ the greatest need. Far too many New Yorkers suffer under the current system. This proposal from OPTN fails to solve those problems.

+0.79 So, post-hack, Equifax gets $$$ in a no-bid IRS contract & potentially profits selling ID protection to hack victims? We deserve answers.

+0.97 For far too long, DC lobbyists have held a chokehold on the 74,000 page U.S. Tax Code, Bloated with carve-outs and gimmicks meant to incentivize one industry over another, the US has the least competitive tax system in the industrialized world. That changes today w/ #TaxReform

+0.11 Further proof that blue collar workers will be hit hardest by #TrumpTax plan: Non-partisan analysis shows many American workers would see a 25.4 percent tax INCREASE by 2021 & EVERYONE making under $75,000 would see some level of tax INCREASE.
+0.11 Sexual harassment & assault are unacceptable & must not be tolerated. Ethics Committee will investigate the troubling allegations regarding Sen. Franken’s conduct. We must all work to change the culture that has too often enabled or permitted sexual harassment & assault.
+0.11 Richard #Cordray did an admirable job as head of @CFPB.  He was tough but fair & always remained independent, even when outside forces tried to apply political pressure. My full statement:
+0.11 The #TrumpTax plan set to pass this week is an attack on students. It would end deduction for interest on #studentloans & impose new tax on need-based tuition waivers. Working families can’t afford Trump's so-called tax ‘relief’ that would raise costs on middle-class households.
+0.11 The cost of war is staggering. This must-read @CostsOfWar study from @BrownUniversity’s @WatsonInstitute helps put it in perspective:

+0.26 Thursday the house will vote on tax cuts at the expense of American families.  The irony -- many of the provisions being stripped away for individual filers remain for corporations...yeah...makes allot of sense, right?
+0.26 Republican leaders are finally admitting what we all knew: the #GOPTaxBill will raise taxes on middle class families. We deserve better than a bill that takes from our families and gives to big corporations & the well connected!
+0.26 Speaker Ryan has said the bill is focused on the middle class, but that is simply not true. It’s really the opposite: it’s a bill built for millionaires. And the process used to consider it has been driven by desperation, rather than deliberation.
+0.26 Thank you, @AARPadvocates for joining Democrats to speak out about the ways @HouseGOP’s tax bill will make it harder for older Americans to afford medical expenses.
+0.26 EITC has improved the economic well-being of childless workers and noncustodial parents . GOP says no in Tax Reform. 
+0.26 The #GOPTaxScam promises that ending tax deductions for teachers, medical expenses, student loans, mortgages, and more will "trickle down." My constituents are done waiting for failed economics to work. Let's try putting working families first.
+0.26 Take moment to watch, I introduced an amendment to strengthen the Adoption Credit - that was rejected in our committee markup.  Pro-Life much right?
+0.26 With nearly 40% of taxpayers who make $50K-75K a year benefiting from the State & Local Tax deduction, it's hard to understand why the @HouseGOP wants to eliminate it. This plan puts #BillionairesFirst.
+0.93 Big day on Capitol Hill! I'm on my way to Chair the 5G Broadband Hearing, then meeting w/ @realDonaldTrump about the #TaxBill, and then voting yes for tax relief for the American people!
+0.93 Honored to speak at the @aga_naturalgas Women's Leadership Conference. Natural gas is a crucial part of our nation's energy security.
+0.93 Just finished a markup on 4 bills at the Energy and Commerce Committee that will roll back harmful Obama-era EPA regulations. One of the bills is for Motorsports! Visit http://MarshaBlackburn.Gov  to learn more.
+0.93 Watch my opening statement on response and recovery efforts following natural disasters. I’ve introduced the Good Samaritan Health Professionals Act which provides important protections for health care professionals to volunteer in the aftermath of a natural disaster.
+0.93 Pay to play? I led a letter to the FBI in July 2016 with over 60 of my colleagues calling for an investigation of the Clinton Foundation's involvement with the Uranium One deal. The American people deserve answers.
+0.93 Awesome to see firsthand what prospective CDL drivers learn at @Ask_Motte CDL school. Truly impressive education.
