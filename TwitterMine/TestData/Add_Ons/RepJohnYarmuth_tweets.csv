This isn‚Äôt tax reform. It‚Äôs a huge gift to the wealthy &amp; a complete abdication of any responsibility to help struggling families get ahead.
"People with health problems, serious illnesses, cancer, etc. will no longer be able to deduct their high medical expenses under this plan."
"Families who rely on the state &amp; local income and sales tax deductions will see them disappear. In KY, that‚Äôs an avg deduction of ~$9,500."
"Students, often DROWNING in student loan debt from high interest rates &amp; the high costs of college, will see their tax deduction eliminated."
Teachers who pay for classroom supplies for their students OUT OF THEIR OWN POCKETS will lose their tax deduction under this GOP plan.
"For starters, it explodes our debt &amp; deficits. This isn‚Äôt about fiscal responsibility. Never has been. It's about helping donors &amp; the rich."
The Ryan-McConnell tax plan cuts corporate rates by 43%. You might wonder how they could possibly pay for that big of a cut. Here's how:

This budget and the tax cuts that will follow fail the American people on all fronts.
"The American people deserve a budget that invests in their future, a tax code that is fair, and a full and honest debate on both."
The GOP is rushing their tax plan to the floor because they don‚Äôt want you to know what's in it.
The fight now shifts to the GOP tax plan that will be brought to the House floor in just a matter of weeks.
"Medicare.
Medicaid.
Social Security.
Nutrition assistance.

Vital services and benefits for American families will ALL be at risk."
"Once the tax cuts blow a huge hole in the budget, new attacks on programs that help Americans get by and get ahead will soon follow."
"These tax cuts will INCREASE our debt and deficits by $1.5 trillion.

That's $1,500,000,000,000."
"It includes trillions of $ in tax cuts that benefit the wealthy &amp; corporations, while increasing taxes on millions of middle class families."
It cuts Medicare and Medicaid by nearly $2 trillion.
"It cuts critical national priorities by more than $5 trillion. Education, health care, research, and infrastructure are ALL threatened."
"Congress just approved a shockingly extreme budget.

I‚Äôve called on @GovMattBevin to withdraw his request. He hasn't. So families must be prepared. I'll share @HHSGov's response once received.
"This isn't rhetoric, it's a serious warning for those covered by our Medicaid expansion, particularly those with serious medical conditions."
"Unless @GovMattBevin reverses course, KY families covered by Medicaid expansion must prepare for their health coverage to be taken away."
".@GovMattBevin has put KY in a dangerous no-win situation. 85,000 will lose coverage if his waiver is approved, far more if it is denied."
