America must not forget lessons of the past. Now is the time for bold leadership to reduce nuclear weapons. We cannot afford a new Cold War.
"It's Trump who needs to come to his senses. World leaders agree our planet needs fewer nuclear weapons, not more. https://t.co/L82ZDo7v5Z"
Both GOP and Democratic security experts have said Trump lacks the temperament to command US nuclear arsenal. This week we are seeing why.
"As @POTUS, Trump will have absolute authority to initiate nuclear war with no check on this power. Far too much power for any one person."
Trump isn't even in @WhiteHouse and he's already threatening to upend decades of US nuclear policy &amp; plunge us into dangerous new arms race.
