"Synthetic drug abuse is a national issue, but it affects us here in #PA15, too. #HR3537 is crucial to protecting our communities."
#HR3537 will help protect against overdoses &amp; gruesome killings like the one in Bethlehem that involved a man who had ingested flakka.
#HR3537 is critical in designating these substances as the dangerous and abusive products that they are.
"Sadly through modifications to the chemical formulas of these drugs, there's been an increase in new substances and new victims."
#HR3537 would increase the number of synthetic drugs under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA).
Today my bill #HR3537 the Dangerous Synthetic Drug Control Act will come to the House floor for a vote. It's time to act against these drugs
