"The President has already tried to stimulate the economy with massive deficit spending. It failed then, and would fail again. #SOTU"
President's corporate #taxreform plan would reduce tax rates for big business – but not for hardworking individuals and families. #SOTU
True #taxreform would remove loopholes and use the savings to lower rates for both businesses and individuals. #SOTU
Any attempt to bypass Congress undermines the system of checks &amp; balances established by our founders in the Constitution. #SOTU
