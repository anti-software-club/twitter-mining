".@WSJ editorial: ""It‚Äôs a shame there won‚Äôt be a vote, because the 529 tax increase is a rare example of the President‚Äôs policy sincerity"""
I strongly urge the President to now work w/ Congress to pass my bipartisan plan to strengthen &amp; expand 529 college savings plans. (3-3)
Had the President succeeded he would have removed a powerful incentive for families to save for their children‚Äôs education. (2-3)
President Obama listened to the American people &amp; dropped his new tax proposal on #529plans. (1-3)

HR 529 makes 3 important improvements to #529plans. Read more about the bill here: http://t.co/VVaUixFIvu
My legislation preserves #529plans for middle class families to help put the dream of higher education within the reach of more Americans.
We should seek opportunities to empower &amp; support middle class families who are preparing for their future &amp; saving through #529plans.
Taxing #529plans - like Obama proposed - will only lead to less savings for the middle class &amp; removes the incentive to save for education.
HR 529 strengthens #529plans for families so all Americans have the opportunity to send their kids to the higher education of their choice.
"HR 529: expands, strengthens, &amp; modernizes #529Plans http://t.co/i6MPWbX1Vn"
