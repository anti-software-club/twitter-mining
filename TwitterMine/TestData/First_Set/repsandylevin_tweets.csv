Ice cream does not have the same impact that scientists have found from tanning.
"It is really unfortunate &amp; sad that we're taking up this bill in this way, w/o single hearing on this bill so that people can raise issues."
The ideology: Get rid of taxes regardless. The regardless is the lives of many people that are at stake.
"There's no golden eggs that come out of these tanning salons. To lose $600M because of this, really raises Qs about the recklessness."
"I'm sure there are jobs involved w the tanning tax, but the basic issue is health. Evidence is clear: tanning can be a source of cancer."
Nothing is more important than one's health care. Nothing. And to minimize it is a mistake.
When it's said ACA is anecdotes - no it isn't. It's the lives of millions who have benefited from ACA.
