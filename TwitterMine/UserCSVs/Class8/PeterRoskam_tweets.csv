"+0.76 There's simply no military, security, or other strategic reason to relocate some of the world’s most dangerous terrorists to US soil."
+0.76 I traveled to #Guantánamo Bay last fall and saw first-hand the important role it plays in our military’s efforts to keep our country safe.
+0.76 It was a bad idea when I opposed it in 2009 and it’s a bad idea today. The only difference now is that it’s also illegal. #Guantánamo
+0.76 The American people overwhelmingly objected &amp; we passed a law making it illegal to transfer GTMO detainees to our shores. Period. Full stop.
+0.76 More than 6 years ago the president tried to relocate the #Guantánamo Bay detention facility to Illinois.
+0.76 The last thing we should be doing right now is willfully bringing terrorists into our country just so @POTUS can fulfill a campaign pledge
"+0.76 #Iran, the world's largest state sponsor of terror, just cashed a $100 billion check that even @POTUS admits will be used for terrorism"
"+0.76 #ISIS controls large swaths of territory in Iraq, Syria, and Libya."
