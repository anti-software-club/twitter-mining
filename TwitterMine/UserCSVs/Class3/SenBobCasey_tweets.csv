"+0.28 .@JoeBiden has said ""Don’t tell me what you value, show me your budget and I’ll tell you what you value."""
"+0.28 In total, the GOP tax plan gives almost 3 trillion in tax cuts to wealthy Americans and profitable corporations over the next 10 years."
+0.28 That’s equivalent to the total annual funding for Pell grants ($22.5 billion FY17) and WIC ($6.35 billion).
+0.28 Repealing the estate tax would reduce revenue by roughly $27 billion/year.
"+0.28 That’s equal to entire FY17 budget for the @CDCgov ($7.2B), the FAA ($16.4B), the @TSA ($7.78) and the @USCG ($10.45B)."
+0.28 The GOP’s purposed changes to the top individual tax bracket will reduce revenue by about $42 billion/year.
"+0.28 That’s equal to the entire FY17 budget for the @NIH ($34.1 billion), @CustomsBorder ($14.3 billion), and @FEMA ($11.6 billion) combined."
+0.28 The purposed GOP cuts for Pass-through/S-corps will reduce revenue by roughly $60 billion/year.
"+0.28 That’s equal to our military’s annual personnel costs (salary, healthcare, retirement contributions, etc) PLUS NASA’s entire annual budget."
+0.28 Let’s start with the proposed cut to the corporate tax rate: $1.5 trillion over 10 years or $150 billion/year.
+0.28 So just how much would we have to cut to keep the deficit the same? Take a look at the numbers.
"+0.28 How, you ask? By definition, tax cuts reduce revenue. If you don't make cuts equal to that reduction, you increase the deficit."
+0.28 Republicans are now proposing to wipe that away with a budget and tax plan that will drastically increase the deficit.

"+0.28 That’s right, this hedge fund manager loophole dwarfs the entire budget of the primary department responsible for responding to emergencies."

"+0.28 Despite that, the Trump admin is planning to put them on a plane TODAY. A plane ride that can very likely lead to their death."
"+0.28 Targeted for death, this mother fled with her 5yr old child. The child is potentially eligible for Special Immigrant Juvenile Status."
+0.28 Here's their story: the 5yr old's mother witnessed the murder of her cousin in Honduras and was being pursued by gangs.
+0.28 This mother &amp; child are being held at a facility in Berks county &amp; are being sent into danger despite the child being eligible for relief.

+0.28 I stand in solidarity w/ Egypt's Christian community following today's heinous attacks.
"+0.28 When China cheats, PA loses. It's disappointing @realDonaldTrump failed to negotiate measurable change in China's behavior during summit."
+0.28 I was critical of President Bush &amp; @POTUS44 for failing to hold China accountable on trade &amp; was hopeful @realDonaldTrump would do so.
+0.28 .@realDonaldTrump summit w/ China's President was all talk and no action when it comes to China's cheating on trade
"+0.28 Last week I wrote @POTUS and identified areas where China is cheating on trade: overcapacity, currency manipulation, steel dumping"
"+0.28 During his summit w/ China's President, @POTUS failed to hold China accountable for cheating on trade"
+0.28 Assad's ability to terrorize Syrians is directly related to support from Russia/Iran. @POTUS must stand up to both. #SyriaStrikes
+0.28 In short: strikes appropriate but larger strategy needed. Further action requires authorization. @POTUS should rescind his travel ban today
+0.28 Further action by @POTUS in Syria requires authorization from Congress. I called for an AUMF under @POTUS44 as well. #SyriaStrikes
+0.28 .@POTUS should immediately rescind his discriminatory travel ban so Syrian refugees can resettle after appropriate vetting #SyriaStrikes
+0.28 .@POTUS was rightly moved by images of attacks on Syrians but his travel ban prevents those same people from resettling here #SyriaStrikes
+0.28 Part of @POTUS' strategy on Syria should be to accelerate humanitarian assistance #SyriaStrikes
"+0.28 While last night's strikes were appropriate, @POTUS must lay out a comprehensive strategy on both Syria &amp; ISIS #SyriaStrikes"
+0.28 There is no purely military solution to the conflict in Syria &amp; I oppose large scale deployment of U.S. ground forces #SyriaStrikes
+0.28 It's incumbent upon @POTUS to outline a strategy for how last night's strikes move us closer to political transition in Syria #SyriaStrikes
+0.28 Last night's targeted strikes against Assad regime were appropriate &amp; proportionate #SyriaStrikes
"+0.28 Can't make this up: @SpeakerRyan's new health care plan is  an ""invisible risk sharing program"" These guys.... https://t.co/dA8CkNYn4o"
+0.28 After my review it was clear that Judge Gorsuch's judicial philosophy would stack the deck against workers &amp; families #StopGorsuch
"+0.28 I had concerns about the process for nominating Judge Gorsuch but I met w/ him, reviewed his record- that's advise and consent #StopGorsuch"
+0.28 These stats don't even account for the outrageous treatment of Merrick Garland by @SenateGOP #StopGorsuch
+0.28 Think about that: over half of all motions to cut off debate on nominations in U.S. history were forced by @SenateGOP under @BarackObama
"+0.28 Under @BarackObama, @SenateGOP required motions to cut off debate on 79 nominations- over 50 percent of all nominations in U.S. history"
+0.28 From nation's founding through @POTUS44 first term: motion to cut off debate filed on just 147 nominations.
+0.28 Judge Gorsuch is too extreme for scotus but we should also talk about how we got here (I.e 'nuclear option by Senate Rs) #StopGorsuch
"+0.28 Judge Gorsuch's legal philosophy is disconnected from the everyday lives of Americans. Workers need justice, not some theory #StopGorsuch"
+0.28 Current scotus ruled 8-0 against Judge Gorsuch's legal theory concerning children w/ disabilities. He's out of the mainstream. #StopGorsuch
"+0.28 A trench worker, a trucker driver were protected by other courts but Judge Gorsuch's judicial philosophy led him to rule for corporations"
+0.28 @realDonaldTrump should never have selected a nominee from a list provided by far right groups like Heritage Foundation/Federalist Society
+0.28 Under the Roberts Court big corporations too often win out over workers. Judge Gorsuch would exacerbate this trend. #StopGorsuch
+0.28 Judge Gorsuch has a rigid judicial philosophy which leads him to come down on the side of powerful interests/big corporations #StopGorsuch
+0.28 To prevent scotus from moving further in the direction of big corporations we must #StopGorsuch. Watch now: https://t.co/sMFm7crMwu
+0.28 Heading down to the Senate floor in a few minutes to talk about why Judge Gorsuch's judicial philosophy is far too extreme for scotus
+0.28 Now who needs a free puppy? https://t.co/N3E4mWvPSy
"+0.28 Why? Since January 1st, over 80,000 Pennsylvanians have written me with concerns about Russia. They want answers, I do too."
"+0.28 .@realDonaldTrump will continue his attempts to distract us from getting to the bottom of this, but we can't let that happen."
+0.28 So the key issue here is the growing body of reporting on the #Trumprussia connections.
+0.28 To be clear – it is one thing for a sitting NSA to ask that individuals in intel reports be “unmasked” – that’s very different than leaking.
"+0.28 Enter the ‘unmasking’ issue. If a NatSec Advisor saw something concerning in intel &amp; didn't ask questions, they wouldn't be doing their job."
"+0.28 With the wiretap claim debunked by... EVERY credible stakeholder, team Trump moves on to the next one."
+0.28 To the point where @realDonaldTrump tweets a blatant fabrication about being 'wiretapped' by @POTUS44.
"+0.28 More questions about #Trumprussia, more distractions from @realDonaldTrump."
+0.28 Distract from what? @RepAdamSchiff can explain it better than I can: https://t.co/TTTPBONbHT
"+0.28 Blame a 400lb guy in his basement, blame @POTUS44, blame @HillaryClinton, blame the media, blame @AmbassadorRice."
"+0.28 .@realDonaldTrump should want to get to the bottom of Russia's meddling no matter what. Instead, it's dodge, distract, and deny."
+0.28 Let that sink in if you haven't already- that's a gravely serious matter for our nation.
"+0.28 Reminder: The FBI is investigating possible collusion between the sitting President, his campaign, his associates and a foreign power."
"+0.28 In case it wasn't obvious, this whole discussion of 'unmasking' is a classic @realDonaldTrump distraction from the FBI investigation."
"+0.28 So the #Trumprussia investigation and ""unmasking."" I have some thoughts."
