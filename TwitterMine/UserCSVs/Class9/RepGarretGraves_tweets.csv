"+0.80 It’s time for tax code reform that is fairer, flatter, and simpler."
+0.80 Doing your taxes shouldn’t be complicated.
"+0.80 We need a simpler, fairer tax code along with a simpler, fairer IRS."
+0.80 Tax code reform should create a service-first IRS.
"+0.80 It should make it easier to create jobs, raise wages, and expand opportunity for all Americans…"
"+0.80 A new tax code should not only make it easier to do your taxes, but also give you peace of mind."
+0.80 We must make simplicity and fairness high priority with tax code reform.
+0.80 We must offer a way to dramatic reform without increasing the deficit.
+0.80 We can’t have a better tax code if we don’t have an IRS that puts taxpayers first.
+0.80 It should make America the greatest place in the world to hire and invest.
+0.80 Our tax code should be fair and simple for everyone…
"+0.80 To put it plainly, we need a new tax code."
+0.80 The IRS has consistently violated the trust of the American taxpayer.
"+0.80 Our tax code isn’t promoting growth.  In fact, it’s pushing jobs overseas."
+0.80 Every year it takes more just to do your taxes than pay them… It’s unacceptable.
"+0.80 It’s made up of high rates, special interest breaks, and regulations that are too complicated to even understand…"
"+0.80 Bottom line, our tax code is a mess."

+0.80 There is a #betterway to fight poverty in the our country. Weigh in on this issue https://t.co/bRSHuaFZq5
+0.80 I want to redesign anti-poverty programs so that they effectively move people off of anti-poverty programs and into jobs.
+0.80 And we have to get people connected with opportunities in the marketplace to break the cycle of poverty in our communities.
"+0.80 Or, to put it another way, we should invest in the programs that increase individual’s self-reliance and reduce government dependence."
+0.80 We have to rethink spending on these programs in terms of how effectively they move people through and off of them.
+0.80 Entitlement spending as we know it today erodes self-reliance and often leads to patterns of increasing gov dependence.
+0.80 Every system is perfectly designed to get the results it gets. The welfare system is flawed &amp; needs a self-sufficiency redesign.
"+0.80 Yet, the poverty rate over the same period of time has been largely unchanged. Why?"
+0.80 American taxpayers have spent over $20 trillion on anti-poverty programs in the 50+ years of the “War on Poverty”…

+0.80 We’re working to redesign programs to do just that while pushing job-creating economic policies.
+0.80 Our welfare system should be designed to help individuals find jobs and stay employed.
+0.80 Gov programs should be evaluated by the volume and frequency of people moving through &amp; out of them.
+0.80 Creating opportunities for full-time work is the way to move the poverty needle in the US.
+0.80 It’s time to face the facts: government can’t fix poverty. But a job-creating economy can.
+0.80 Hardworking taxpayers. No wonder most Americans are frustrated with the government.
+0.80 So we’re taking from those who need it &amp; giving to those who don’t – and guess who’s on the hook?
"+0.80 Additionally, recent reports by gov watchdogs show welfare benefits are often paid to ineligible individuals…"
+0.80 …but these programs aren’t delivering positive outcomes for the most vulnerable members of our communities.
+0.80 Entitlement spending has exploded – roughly $1T a year by when you roll all the programs up…
