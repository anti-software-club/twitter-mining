"+0.88 #Obamacare is an inequality Godzilla that has robbed working families of their insurance, their doctors, their wages and their jobs."
"+0.88 Inequality is changing laws without congressional approval, &amp; spying on Americans without constitutional authority. http://t.co/86tmlHtLdj"
"+0.88 Inequality is the federal government hurting rural communities, especially in the West, by controlling and mismanaging public lands."
+0.88 Inequality is denying citizens the right to define marriage in their states as traditionally or as broadly as their diverse values dictate.
+0.88 Inequality is blocking thousands of middle-class energy jobs as a favor to partisan donors &amp; radical environmental activists.

+0.88 I support immigration reform. But #Go8 is not immigration reform. It is big government dysfunction. I am voting no: http://t.co/0Rx1s0lT78
"+0.88 There's simply no legitimate reason why we have to pass a one-size-fits-all 1,200-page, take-it-or-leave-it #immigration bill."
+0.88 the only reason #immigration reform is so controversial is because the Senate refuses to pass it one piece at a time.
+0.88 The House appears to have learned from #Go8 dysfunction and wants no part of this.  They are passing step-by-step reforms.
+0.88 The special interests had a huge hand in writing the #Go8 bill while the American people had no role: http://t.co/1XCVo3oPh5
+0.88 The so-called comprehensive approach has been utterly discredited. #Go8 bill reaffirms why vast majority of Americans distrust Washington.
+0.88 The #Go8 process has revealed all the problems inherent in passing massive pieces of legislation that try to fix all of problems at once.
"+0.88 For grand finale, the #Go8 proponents substituted what is effectively a brand-new bill instead of the one we've been debating for 2 months."
"+0.88 For a 1,200-page bill we were allowed exactly nine roll call votes to amend #Go8 before the process was shut down."
"+0.88 They said there would be regular order for #Go8 on the floor of the senate, but that turned out to be a false promise as well."
+0.88 During committee markup Democrats &amp; #Go8 Republicans voted as a block to defeat virtually all substantive amendments to improve the bill.
+0.88 We were told that if we didn't like what was in #Go8 that we'd have an opportunity to fix it. But that wasn't true either.
"+0.88 From day one, the country was misled about what was in #Go8 bill. The talking points never matched bill's reality: http://t.co/8uM7N7bSFY"
"+0.88 As a matter of process, senators should be embarrassed about how #Go8 bill has moved through the senate. http://t.co/ADQzNcmdHx"
"+0.88 According to CBO, #Go8 will reduce illegal immigration by just a mere 25% over the next ten years: reason alone to scrap entire bill."
"+0.88 The #Go8 bill transfers too much authority &amp; discretion to the executive branch, exacerbating an already widespread problem in federal gov."
+0.88 The #Go8 bill remains grossly unfair to those who have languished in our current legal immigration system for decades.
+0.88 The #Go8 bill cuts the American people out by cutting out congressional oversight of pathway to citizenship process: http://t.co/crWlm7SzM7
"+0.88 #Go8 bill is full of promises to beef up border security, but it makes no assurances. http://t.co/LRAJAOWJP5"
"+0.88 As a matter of public policy, #Go8 fails to meet many of the goals that we set to meet at the beginning of the process."

+0.88 There are more than 40 individual pieces of immigration-related legislation that have been introduced in this congress alone.
+0.88 I support legal #immigration into our country and recognize that immigration is vital to nation's success.
"+0.88 Far from “good,” S7.44 repeats the mistakes of the past, makes our #immigration system worse, and will lead to bigger problems."
"+0.88 There are reports that Democrats have asked CBO to evaluate S.744, but report won’t be published until next week. #betterlatethannever"

+0.88 WATCH @ChuckGrassley explain how claims that there will be stiff penalties for those who broke law are false. http://t.co/68NYyB7FTH
+0.88 S.744 is inherently unfair to the many who have tried to navigate our current broken immigration system. #CIRfloor
"+0.88 I can certainly see why Congress would want to evade responsibility for consequences of S.744, but our republic shouldn't function this way."
"+0.88 S.744 authorizes the Secretary of Homeland Security in hundreds of instances, to simply ignore #immigration law. #CIRfloor"
"+0.88 S.744 surrenders control of #immigration law to the Secretary of Homeland Security and other unelected, unaccountable bureaucrats. #CIRfloor"
+0.88 S.744 leaves Congress and the American people out of the loop. #CIRfloor
"+0.88 As branch of gov. most accountable to people, Congress must play a vital role in approving, overseeing, and verifying #immigration reforms."
+0.88 S.744 offers no congressional oversight of how the executive branch implements these immigration reforms. #CIRfloor
"+0.88 If all we do is fix border-security portion, #immigration bill is still considerably weak in major areas, and is still unworthy of support."
+0.88 Failing to secure the border is the quickest way to repeat the mistakes of the past. #CIRFloor
