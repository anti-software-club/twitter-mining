+0.95 @ClemsonBull I support removal of exemption and see no reason why it wouldn't pass as stand alone unless Dems filibuster it.

"+0.95 @ClemsonBull amendment further rollsback O-Care. We've been studying that for years. As Dems like to remind me, voted for repeal 40+ times"
+0.95 @ClemsonBull there's a large misinformation campaign going on out there to kill the bill. Very disappointing.
+0.95 @ClemsonBull More important will be the score on bill that the senate sends back
"+0.95 @ClemsonBull we have CBO score on main text language, which gives largest blueprint. But as I said, Senate will make lots of changes."
+0.95 @ClemsonBull main bill text is whats been available for weeks and is what was marked up in committee. McArthur amendment has been public
+0.95 @ClemsonBull that's why we're very hopeful senate can polish it and make it better. But they need a bill from House to start that process.
"+0.95 @ClemsonBull great thought has been put in House bill, but there's lots of uncertainty about what can &amp; can not be included."
+0.95 @ClemsonBull what can and can not be included in a reconciliation package. Senators can better determine that. But bill must start in House
+0.95 @ClemsonBull the senate parliamentarian will not speak with House members regarding Senate rules. So it is very difficult to determine...

"+0.95 We owe it to the American people to provide the best security for our nation that we can, from border security to interior security."
+0.95 The refugee settlement program should be suspended at least until ISIS has been defeated &amp; an improved vetting process has been established
+0.95 I call on @POTUS to immediately halt the resettlement of refugees from Syria &amp; other countries with known radical Islamic terrorist cells
+0.95 ISIS will continue to infiltrate &amp; radicalize citizens living within our borders with the goal of committing acts of terror and intimidation

"+0.95 @ryanreal really?  So, by pointing out that ISIS will exploit refugees by their own admission. We can vet (per FBI Director) Syrians."
+0.95 @keithdray ISIS has said it will exploit. We can have compassion but we also have to be smart. It is our country and our communities.
+0.95 @keithdray what I am saying is that the FBI &amp; DHS have both stated that WE CANNOT vet these Syrians due 2 lack of records. ISIS will exploit
+0.95 @ProgressGA @keithdray haven't heard that. I did hear what the suspect said.
+0.95 @Mcwhatdidyousay how about end the gun-free zones?  How about end restrictive gun laws in IL that affect law-abiding citizens not criminals
