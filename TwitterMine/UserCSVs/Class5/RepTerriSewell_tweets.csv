"+0.40 In every generation God calls some men and women for the utterance of truth, a heroic action,"
+0.40 The same religious enthusiasm that nerved Joan of Arc to her work nerves us to ours.

"+0.40 This right no one pretends to deny. We need not prove ourselves equal to Daniel Webster to enjoy this privilege,"
"+0.40 And, strange as it may seem to many, we now demand our right to vote according to the declaration of the government under which we live."
+0.40 We have met to uplift woman's fallen divinity upon an even pedestal with man's.
