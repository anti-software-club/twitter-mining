+0.17 “We don't know how we will pay for a policy increase of over 5X what younger people pay. It will be unaffordable for us.”
"+0.17 “Under Trumpcare with an age tax and a new law that allows insurance companies to punish older Americans, her insurance will soar.”"
+0.17 Peg from Greenwich - “My wife is 60 yrs old and she is self employed. Right now she can afford insurance with ConnectiCare.”
+0.17 “MS isn't a disease I could have prevented. Cuts to Medicaid will make it harder for me to afford the care I need.”
"+0.17 “Without my treatment, I have a good chance of having the disease progress quickly. Luckily, now my treatments are covered."""
+0.17 “Medicaid covers what my Medicare doesn't. I don't know how I would have ever been able to get my treatment and MRIs paid for without it.”

"+0.17 “Her care costs $40,000 each year. Thanks to Medicaid’s Community First Choice program, we’ve finally been able to get financial help.”"

"+0.17 Mark from Westbrook - “My daughter, Dominique has an cerebral palsy. She suffers from seizures and has a number of other health challenges”"
"+0.17 “Rylan is 2 years old now. If Republicans pass their health care bill, his coverage could be in danger.”"

"+0.17 “I was worried his surgery wouldn’t be covered, but thanks to the ACA I didn’t have to worry about him being denied.”"
+0.17 “Rylan was born with a congenital heart defect &amp; had to be rushed to CT Children’s for emergency open heart surgery to keep him alive.”
"+0.17 Isabelle from Unionville - “Before I had my second son, Rylan, I never thought about how my insurance plan worked. I didn’t need to.”"
+0.17 “I’m afraid I won’t be able to access life-sustaining care for myself and my son. I don’t want him to suffer like I did before the ACA.”
"+0.17 “If protections for pre-existing conditions &amp; restricting lifetime caps are not preserved, I fear I will face certain medical bankruptcy.”"
"+0.17 “Before the ACA, the disease made it nearly impossible for me to obtain health coverage, let alone affordable coverage.”"
+0.17 Pamela from Ellington - “I have a potentially life-threatening genetic condition called Hereditary Angioedema (HAE) and so does my son.”
"+0.17 “The Affordable Care Act saved my life. Without it, I’d probably be dead, within months.”"
"+0.17 “I have friends who are on Medicaid who are petrified that if they lose their ability to get it, they won’t have health care.”"
"+0.17 “Health care is the number one priority in my life, it’s more important than income, more important than anything else.”"
"+0.17 “Even in a good health year, I probably have one or two hospitalizations that require IV antibiotics. I’m on a whole suite of medications”"
"+0.17 Jon from Meriden - “I was born with cystic fibrosis, a disease that causes my lungs to fill with fluid.”"
+0.17 To repeal without replacement and guaranteed patient protections is to deny our most vulnerable and most promising the chance of survival
"+0.17 Without the protection of the ACA, she must live not only w the fear of recurrence, but fear of recurrence w no access to affordable care."
"+0.17 “But thanks to the Affordable Care Act, she was able to get the treatment she needs. She has been in remission for 5 years.”"

+0.17 Kamera from Stamford - “I am a single mom to 2 children. My youngest has a rare genetic disease called Lesch-Nyhan Syndrome.”

"+0.17 “He will be 8 and thanks to speech pathologists, occupational therapists and special education he has come a long way.”"
+0.17 Erin from Mashantucket - “My son has autism and has been receiving services through the public school system.”
+0.17 “Surgeries I underwent potentially saved my life &amp; didn't bankrupt our family. No one should choose btwn life-saving surgery &amp; bankruptcy.”
"+0.17 “If the Republican bill passes, my preexisting condition - since birth! - could no longer be covered.”"
"+0.17 Kristen from New Haven - “I am BRCA positive, and though I have taken preventive action, the risk is still there.”"
+0.17 “But no one should have to go through that in order to fight sickness with their loved ones.”
+0.17 “Im fortunate to have had so many yrs to fight alongside my mom. I would've declared bankruptcy if it meant keeping her alive &amp; comfortable”
"+0.17 “The GOP bill would bankrupt families caring for their loved ones. It would make life so much harder for people with ALS."""
+0.17 “ALS is expensive. It's a death sentence. But for now people can live a more comfortable life &amp; wait for a cure because they have insurance”
+0.17 “There are hundreds of thousands of people living with ALS. This bill would force people to chose btwn their loved one or their livelihood.”
+0.17 Melinda from Middletown - “My mom passed away almost 5 years ago from ALS. She fought for 10 years because of Medicare.”
+0.17 “I rely on the ACA &amp; I can’t afford the increases I would pay under the GOP plan. Anyone can get older or sicker.” It shouldn’t be this way.
+0.17 “I went back to the workforce &amp; found out my age made me less competitive in the job market. I ended up with a job but no benefits.”
"+0.17 Julia from Westport - “I’m over age 55. When the recession hit, I got laid off like a lot of Americans”"
+0.17 “I’m 62 years old and I know that I won’t be able to afford the 800% premium increase that would affect me under the new Republican plan.”
+0.17 “I know so many independent businesses that would not be able to survive without the Affordable Care Act.”
+0.17 “I went back to college on my own to re-train and finally climbed back out of the hole. I wouldn’t have been able to do it without the ACA”
"+0.17 “I lost my husband, my insurance and my career in the span of two months. I had to sell our home.”"
+0.17 Paula from Glastonbury - “I had insurance through my husband’s company.” He was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and died 8 weeks later.

"+0.17 “I have always worked hard, at my job and as a caregiver. I did it all with little to no help. ACA was there to help me when I needed it.”"
"+0.17 “Now I am covered and getting treatment for the severe arthritis I developed over my years as a nurse, and for diabetes as well.”"
+0.17 “I no longer have to worry about losing insurance because of the Affordable Care Act. I'm not sure I'd have made it without the ACA.”
+0.17 “I also went through a 10 year period of being the only one able to take care of my older relatives. I cared for both my aunt and my mom.”
"+0.17 “After a job change, layoff, or after divorce, for example. I never could afford COBRA on top of a mortgage and raising kids.”"
+0.17 “I've spent my life seeing to the care and comfort of others. Yet there are times in my life when I've had to go without health care.”
"+0.17 Gretchen from Winstead - “I worked as an LPN for many yrs here in CT. You may think nurses don't have to worry about healthcare, but we do.”"

"+0.17 Paul from Litchfield - “I have a rare interstitial lung disease. I was in the hospital for 48 days, very ill and in critical condition.”"
+0.17 “The story of the ACA is just as much about economic liberation and entrepreneurship as it is about health care.”
+0.17 “Words cannot express the relief I felt when the dread of being denied coverage due to a pre-existing condition evaporated.”
"+0.17 “Thankfully by the time I finished school in 2010, the ACA had passed and I was able to pursue a career path of my choosing”"
+0.17 “I contemplated my post-college job prospects not based on earning potential or interest but based on the insurance that was offered.”
+0.17 Mike from Milford - “I was diagnosed with cancer in 2008 at 21 yrs old.”
+0.17 RT @Emeraldashct: @ChrisMurphyCT Without ACA neither myself of my children would have insurance due to our pre-existing conditions.
+0.17 “I'm concerned my Husky benefits could be affected. I'm finally getting my life &amp; health back. I don't want to go back to how I was living.”
"+0.17 “If it weren't for the coverage I received through the exchange last year, I don't know what would have happened to me.”"

"+0.17 “I couldn't imagine there being a lifetime cap, or needing approval to perform an expensive life-saving procedure.”"
+0.17 “Our daughter’s hospital bills have already reached $1 million and she is only one year old. Her life is worth every penny.”
+0.17 “We are now very nervous about what the new health care policy could mean to our family.”
+0.17 “Our family works very hard and we are blessed that our insurance has made the very long hospital stay and surgeries possible.”
"+0.17 “She's had two open heart surgeries, one when she was only 5 days old. She will need another within the next few years to keep surviving.”"
"+0.17 “My daughter did nothing wrong, I did nothing wrong while pregnant either. This type of birth defect does not discriminate.”"
+0.17 Melissa from Hebron - “My daughter Riley just turned one year old. She was born with Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome.”
"+0.17 Without insurance “you will quickly spend down all your retirement savings and possibly have to sell your house to boot."""
