"+0.65 Within 60 days of passage, POTUS will have to present to Congress a comprehensive strategy to stabilize region and defeat #ISIL threat."
+0.65 This force would be used to protect American interests and prevent further #ISIL expansion.
"+0.65 Consistent with the War Powers Resolution of 1973, this resolution would give POTUS a 120 day authorization to use force against #ISIL."
+0.65 The responsibility and power to declare war and authorize commitment of US forces lies with Congress.
